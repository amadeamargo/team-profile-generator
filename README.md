# team-profile-generator

The team profile generator is a quick and easy way to compile your team's information in a clean and concise manner. 

Run "node index.js" in the command line to start the application. The user will then be prompted to input details about the team manager, including the manager's name, ID, email, and office number. Once this is completed, the user will have the option to add another employee (either an intern or an engineer) to the team list or to be done with the employee list. 

If an intern is added to the list, the user will then be prompted to ionput the intern's name, ID, email, and school name. 
If an engineer is added to the list, the user will then be prompted to ionput the engineer's name, ID, email, and gitHub user.

Once the employe list is complete, the application will create a new html page containing all of the added employee's details.
